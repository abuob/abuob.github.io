Absolute fantastic address for Cordon Bleus with plenty of choices and amazing French Fries.

The choice in size is between 500g and "less", where "less" is around 300g.
I chose the bigger portion - not because I was hungry but because I love taking home leftovers to have for the evening/day after.

We were both very happy with what we've got, certainly an address we can imagine visiting again!
