The Sternen used to be one of our go-to places for a Cordon Bleu - easily accessible for both me and my friend (just a few minutes by train from Bern), fantastic service,
amazing food and overall always just a nice experience.

So we were quite sad when we learned about the upcoming retirement of the cook - definitely deserved though!

In any case, June 19, 2025 was our last visit to the Sternen before it closed. The owner luckily found someone to take over so it's reopened these days,
but with a different menu and without the Cordon Bleus we were enjoying so much.
