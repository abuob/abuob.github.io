The "Brasserie Obstberg" is quite close to the Rosengarten in Bern, somewhat hidden among residential buildings.
It's more posh than I had expected - the other visitors present that day were, unlike myself, certainly dressed the part, which made me feel a bit out of place.

I didn't explicitly go there for the Cordon Bleu, I happened to have received a restaurant voucher for it.
Anyhow, they advertised their Cordon Bleu as a specialty of the house on the menu, so I certainly had to try it out! And special it certainly was.
The veal was cooked to medium only, not something I'm accustomed to in the context of a Cordon Bleu.
And while it was definitely an experience worth having and I respect the choice of going for something a bit different, it wasn't quite my cup of tea.

The accompanying pommes allumettes together with the home-made sauce were an absolute treat though!
