I'm writing these lines quite a while after our visit to the Krone - but it's one of the more memorable Cordon Bleu trips I've made with my friend.

Once we've let the waiter know that we're there for Cordon Bleus, he almost insisted on us trying out the home-made "café de Paris"-sauce with the Cordon Bleu.
Not exactly something we're typically used to but who are we to oppose him - so we ordered a portion of café de Paris (not visible on the photo unfortunately).
It was certainly the right choice!

Definitely one of the top addresses in Bern. Amazing French fries, solid choice of sauces, a waiter that clearly knows what he's serving, and - almost a side-note -
fantastic Cordon Bleus.
