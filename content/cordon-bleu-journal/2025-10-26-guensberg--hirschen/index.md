The Hirschen in Günsberg prides itself with its Cordon Bleu "Factory" - they even have various ["Cordonbleumat"](https://cordonbleumat.ch/) all over the region.
The menu offers various Cordon Bleus with all kinds of fillings, even some rather adventurous ones that neither me nor my friend have seen before.

So, the expectations were quite high before the visit. And I have to say... it was okay, but given the expectations, it felt a bit like a letdown.
