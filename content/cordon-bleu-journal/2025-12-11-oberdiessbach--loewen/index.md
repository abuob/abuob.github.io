Not my first visit of the Löwen - they have quite a few different choices of Cordon Bleu available.
I was visiting during the week, and a classic Cordon Bleu was one of the daily menus, and of course I can't resist.

The size is perfect for a lunch during the week, no need to take the rest of the day off afterwards.
The meat was hammered thin and soft, allowing the cheese to shine.
