# Why have a website?

This is a question I've asked myself a while already.
So far throughout my life, I've found the anonymity the internet provides rather comforting.
Why should anyone be able to connect my name to what I write online? Or look up who I am?

For the most part, I still believe that it's better to just stay anonymous.
However, a website allows me to put online what I want, under my own terms - which fits my needs perfectly.

## No social media

I try to avoid social media as much as I can, especially if they rely on an ad-based business-model.
Hordes of engineers optimizing algorithms to keep eyeballs glued to the screen as much as possible - and just as many data engineers trying to squeeze out
every last bit of harvestable data to sell to the highest bidder: No thanks, I'd rather do without.

Unfortunately, this also means that I'm essentially completely "unsearchable" - if anyone happens to search for me,
they're likely to find nothing, or worse, find someone with the same or a similar name and mistaking them for me (which has already happened in the past).

A website at least makes me findable on the internet, while only providing data to the harvesters that I consciously allow them to have.

## Thoughts and ideas, in writing

I do have opinions and thoughts on many things - writing them down helps to flesh them out.
Gaps in the train of thought might surface.
If they're put out online, they'd better be thought through properly; after all, they're public now.

## So, here we go!

Not quite sure yet where this leads. The current idea is to have an about-page with a bit of information about me, 
a contact-page so someone could contact me if they're so inclined - and a little blog, of which this is the first entry. 
Maybe some pieces on some technical topics follow, maybe some political rambling, or whatever else goes through my head.

Let's just get this started and see how it goes :)
