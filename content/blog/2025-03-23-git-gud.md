At the beginning of my career, I didn't really care much about git.
It was just a tool to save my code and collaborate with others, and any command which allowed me to do so was good enough.
I found a lot of the git-commands to be opaque, and struggled with any issue outside of my usual workflow:

{{< figure src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png" width="330" height="478" caption="[xkcd 1597: Git](https://xkcd.com/1597/)" >}}

The thing that made git click for me was when I finally started to look beyond the docs and explanation of commands,
at how git actually works under the hood. The data model is relatively simple, and once I had a grasp of it,
a lot of commands immediately started to make sense.

Furthermore, the more experience I gathered as a developer, the more it was clear to me that some basic git hygiene can go a long way, especially in bigger projects with many contributors
(such as [monorepositories]({{< relref "/blog/2024-10-27-frontend-monorepositories-why-im-a-fan.md" >}}) at my work).
I have become more and more fond of linear history approaches,
which is very easy to enforce and makes it incredibly easy to reason about incremental changes to the codebase (see also below).

## About this guide

I've initially written this guide in similar form for work-purposes (this might shine through here and there),
to enable developers to work on a project that enforces linear history.

This guide is meant for people who are familiar with basic commands such as `git checkout/commit/push/pull/merge/add`,
but are generally not using any commands that rewrite history. If you're familiar with commands such as
`git rebase`, `git reset` or `git merge --squash`, this guide offers maybe no new insights for you, but could
maybe serve as a cheat-sheet for various git-commands.

Note: There is a "Troubleshooting"-section at the bottom, if you're looking for a specific solution to a problem, have a look there!

## What is a linear history and why should I care?

A linear history is essentially a history where every commit is limited to having exactly one parent - or in
other words, the history does not contain merge-commits.

{{< figure src="/images/2025/linear-history.png" width="490" height="475" caption="Different git-histories: Non-linear, linear and 'semi-linear' (gitlab terminology). Image from [bitsnbites.eu](https://www.bitsnbites.eu/a-tidy-linear-git-history/)" >}}

The advantages should be self-evident: It is easier to read, it establishes an obvious order in which
changes are applied, it is easier to see which commits introduced e.g. a broken build, it allows for more
advanced tool-support (easier to e.g. use `git bisect`, better possibilities for incremental builds, etc.).

The advantages however come at a price: One cannot create merge-commits, which are usually the easiest way
to "update" a branch, especially when conflicts are involved.

In other words - in a non-linear history, "insertion" is easy, but "find, analyze, understand" is hard. In a
linear history, it's exactly the other way around: "insertion" becomes harder - but everything else becomes
significantly easier.

## I'm afraid to touch git stuff, I might break things!

Don't worry! It's essentially _impossible_ (well, not quite, but almost) to break your local git repository.
You really have to put some effort into doing so. However, to get you started, it is recommended to follow
this simple checklist here:

-   Do not use any of the following commands/instructions if you have uncommitted
    changes in your repository that you might want to keep for later
-   Do not rewrite history of branches that other people also work on. And if you do, make sure that everyone
    is aware and approves.

## Some basic concepts

There is this common misconception that a branch is a chain of commits of sorts, a collection of diffs,
something that is bound to the changes you're working on. All wrong! A branch is literally a file containing
the id (hash) of some commit. Or in other words, a pointer. If you need prove, just head over to the `.git/refs/heads`-folder
at the root of a repository (hidden in many IDEs by default, as you never want to touch this one),
you should see a file for every single local branch, and all files just contain a single commit-id. That's it!

Now, what does this mean and why should we care?

Pointers are something that can be moved easily - we just have to point it to something else. And this is
what we will do with our first command.

# Commands

## `git reset`: Change pointers

We now know that a branch is just a pointer, so let's move that pointer. This is where `git reset` comes into play.
There are two basic options (among many others, but these two are the important ones): `git reset --soft`, and `git reset --hard`.

-   `git reset --soft <commit-ish>`: Will set the current branch to the given 'commit-ish' (a commitId or something that
    resolves to a commitId), _without changing any files_. In other words, `git reset --soft` _only_ changes that
    one single file in the `.git/refs/heads`-folder, and does nothing else (...sort of). You can try this out by
    manually changing the commit-id inside such a branch-file - you'll see, it works!
-   `git reset --hard <commit-ish>`: Same as before - but the files get changed as well. To stick with the
    branch-file-analogy; it is the same as if you manually change the commit-id in the branch-file, then run
    `git status`, and then revert every single change until `git status` reports that there is nothing to
    commit. This is the manual version of a `git reset --hard`.

Now let's get our hands dirty: Imagine you're on some random branch, committing away some changes you've made
for some story. You run `git reset --hard HEAD~1`, because this seems like a good idea. But oh noes!
Now everything from your last commit is gone. Or has it?

What happened is this: Your branch points to one commit 'earlier' from where it was before, and all files in your
repo are in the state at which that specific commit was created. But what happened to your 'newest' commit?

## `git reflog`: To the rescue

Git keeps history of your changes - but who keeps history of your history? This is where `git reflog` comes
into play. If you invoke just `git reflog`, you will see a log of all commits that were ever at the "tip" (HEAD)
of your repository. It also keeps track of which 'branch' you are currently on. You can also narrow this
to e.g. a specific branch: `git reflog my-branch` will show you all commits to which `my-branch` has ever pointed.

To solve e.g. a little accident with `git reset --hard` as described above, we can use `git reflog`, copy the
commitId we want to go back to, and just use yet another `git reset --hard` with it.

One note: If there is no branch, tag, or anything else pointing towards a commit, eventually git will assume
that it is "dead" and will garbage-collect it. Unless you configure the garbage collection to be more
aggressive or invoke it manually, it is very unlikely that you ever lose a commit to garbage collection. But git will
clean up for you, so you can create new commits at your heart's content and don't need to worry that
your repository will clutter with "dead" commits.

## `git cherry-pick`: Create new history... and rewrite it too?

`git cherry-pick` will be our first command that actually creates a new commit. So far, we've just moved pointers forth
and back using reset, and kept track of it using reflog. `git cherry-pick <commitId>` takes the changeset
of the provided commit and tries to apply it on top of your HEAD. You can also provide multiple commitIds,
it will just apply one after another from left to right. If there is a conflict, git will halt the cherry-picking-process,
allowing you to resolve the conflicts - when done, git resumes after invoking `git cherry-pick --continue`.
If, for whatever reason, the cherry-pick would result in an empty commit, git will also halt and allow you
to either use `git cherry-pick --continue --allow-empty` or to use `git cherry-pick --skip`.

This is all nice and creates 'new history', but what we really want is to 'rewrite' history and relinearize it, no?

We can do that with cherry-pick! Imagine you're on a branch, say `my-branch`, you branched off of main.
Now someone else pushes something towards main, and you're not "up-to-date" anymore. What you would like to
do is have your commits on top of these other changes. In order to achieve that, we can use `git reset --hard main`
to set the current branch to the same as main. Now your commits on the feature-branch are gone, and your branch is
practically identical with main! But as we've learned before, we can use `git reflog` to see our previous
commits, and we can then use `git cherry-pick` to apply them on top of our completely fresh, up-to-date `my-branch`.

However, this seems a bit awkward: Fiddling with reflog, copy-pasting commitIds... that's cumbersome! We want
something more productive - let's enter `git rebase`!

## `git rebase`: Rewrite history, faster!

`git rebase`, at its core, is essentially a bunch of cherry-picks without having to reset manually.
This picture hopefully explains the concept:

{{< figure src="/images/2025/git-rebase.gif" width="640" height="359" caption="Rebase visualized (credit: [atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/))" >}}

The picture makes it seem as if everything happens in one go - but it's important to understand that
these things happen one after another. This will help us understand what's going on if things go wrong.
To break it down, what happens is the equivalent of the following:

1. `git reset --hard main`: We're currently, as per picture, on branch `feature/JIRA-123`,
   which is behind main. With reset, we set them on par.
2. `git cherry-pick <green-commit-1> <green-commit-2>"`: Create two new commits, one after another, with
   the same change-set as "green-commit-1"/"green-commit-2".

And voilà, our branch is up-to-date with main again, and still contains our new changes!
Obviously, there might be conflicts - if this is the case, git will stop the rebase-process just as it did
for cherry-picking. You can use `git rebase --continue` to continue once you resolved the conflicts.

## `git rebase -i`: Rewrite history with style!

The `-i` stands for interactive - and opens up a whole new world of possibilities. This allows us a myriad
of way of "touching" commits:

-   Edit: You realize that e.g. three commits ago, you committed something you _really_ want to get
    out of your commit-history (e.g.: accidentally committed a password)? No worries, `git rebase -i` got you covered!
-   Squash/fixup: Create a single commit out of multiple commits
-   Drop: Throw a single commit out, entirely

To continue the example from the picture above, if we execute `git rebase -i main`, an editor will open
that gives us an overview of all commits that will be rebased. In our case, this might look something like this:

```text
pick <green-commit-1> This was the first green commit
pick <green-commit-2> This was the second one
```

Now if we continue as-is, this will be just a normal rebase: First reset, then cherry-picking one commit
after another. However, since we're in interactive mode, we can change this - your editor should show you some options:

```text
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
```

For brevity, I omitted some. So what you can do is something like this:

```text
pick <green-commit-1> This was the first green commit
squash <green-commit-2> This was the second one
```

This will result in a new "squash"-commit which essentially contains the change-sets of the two commits combined.
Squash will result in having a special commit-message, essentially a concatenation of the two previous
commit-messages. The other commands should be hopefully somewhat self-explanatory - if not, just try them out!
As you know, you can always "go back" using the strategies mentioned above.

## <a name="rebase-onto"></a>`rebase --onto`: Even more control!

This parameter gives us more control over _what exactly_ we want to rebase. With `git rebase main`,
git "picked" every commit that was not yet on `main`. But what if, for example, you started to work on
something, believing it to be for `main`, but then your manager tells you all of a sudden that this thing got
priority and needs to go directly to some `release`-branch?

Running `git rebase release` directly is not an option, because it would pick every commit in `main` that is
not yet in `release` and rebase them on top of `release`. Disaster! What you want is to tell git that it should pick every commit that is not yet
on `main`, but then rebase them on top of `release` instead - and this is precisely what `--onto` is for:

```
git rebase --onto release main your_feature_branch
```

If you break the command down to its "components", it's essentially exactly the same process: First, we "reset",
then, we "cherry-pick" - the only difference that `--onto` makes here is that it allows us better to define
which commits need to be picked.

## `git push`: Changing the history books requires some force!

Now you hopefully know the basics on how to rewrite git history. You apply these fancy commands on one
of your feature-branches, and want to push the rewritten version to the remote. But not so fast!

```text
! [rejected]        my-branch -> my-branch (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://...'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

Frankly speaking, this hint is misleading. Do **_NOT_** use `git pull`!
But first of all, why does the remote reject our changes? If you run `git status`, it will tell you
that the remote is X commits ahead and Y commits behind. Since you "created" new commits with rebase,
there is now a difference between your local branch and your upstream tracked version: The remote has still
all the old commits, while your local branch does _not_ have the old commits anymore, but new commits that were
either rebased, squashed or in some other fashion rewritten. With `git push`, you cannot "destroy" or "override"
such commits - you need to specifically tell git that you want to do that. And this is done by using either:

-   `git push --force-with-lease`: The "safer" `--force`-version: It only overwrites the remote if you were aware of its
    complete current state. Meaning, that the remote branch did not change since you last fetched its state.
-   `git push --force`: The same, but without a check. Only use if you're working on your own personal branch
    that nobody else is supposed to touch anyway.

A scenario where the use of `git --force` (instead of `--force-with-lease`) might be fatal could go as follows: You are about
to force-push a change, but seconds before doing so, someone else also updates the remote branch. In that case,
your force-push would completely override the remote branch, even though you're not aware of the new changes yet.
`--force-with-lease` would save you in that regard (this should arguably be the default - it's probably not for historic reasons).

# Writing history: Some best practices & guidelines

Now that we know how to not just write history but also rewrite it, a few words on what we actually
could (and possibly should) do with this.

## What makes a good commit?

If you for example see a commit history such as follows:

```text
// What are these commits good for?
commit-4  "Fix test"
commit-3  "Fix linting"
commit-2  "Fix build"
commit-1  "[FEATURE-123] Add some fancy functionality for this and that purpose"
```

Is there _ever_ the possibility that someone, either you or someone else in the future, is interested
in checking out "commit-1" directly? Not really, right, because it's broken - you'd much rather check out the
fixed version of it, right?

Therefore, one might argue that these commits should not exist in this form to begin with - they clutter history,
do not add any value in and by themselves, they are "just noise". So if you end up with a branch like this,
before merging, it might make sense to use the interactive rebase we've learned about above:

```text
git rebase -i <target-branch>

// In the editor:
pick    commit-1  "[FEATURE-123] Add some fancy functionality for this and that purpose"
fixup   commit-2  "Fix build"
fixup   commit-3  "Fix linting"
fixup   commit-4  "Fix test"
```

Or `squash`, if you want to keep information about the original commits in the resulting commit-message.
That being said, when doing these "fix"-commits, it might make sense to not create separate commits for them at all:
You can use the `git commit --amend`-option to just "modify" (meaning: create a new commit) the current commit
and add the fixes to it.

## Be careful with `git pull`

`git pull` is a "convenience"-command that is essentially just a mix of `git fetch` and `git merge` - the latter
means that it will always create a merge-commit if the branch cannot be fast-forwarded. Hence, it is inherently
a command that does not play nice when you want to keep your history linear. You _can_ provide the `--rebase` option
which makes `git pull` essentially a combination of `git fetch` and `git rebase`, but you might as well invoke rebase yourself.

However, for example on a branch like `main` where you never commit directly yourself and just want to update your branch,
`git pull` is perfectly fine. If we're on a different branch than main and want to update the local branch `main`
either way, we can use `git fetch origin main:main`.

# UI tools

This guide mostly explained terminal-based git-usage, but some people prefer UI-based tools - the heresy! ;)
Most modern IDEs offer some form of integrated git-support, with varying amount of features. Especially support
for interactive rebase, probably one of the more helpful tools for linearization of history, is often lacklustre.

-   [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/): Tries to mimic the text-editor-based approach to interactive rebase as much as possible,
    but without having to fiddle with vim or some other terminal-based editor. [See here](https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/interactive-rebase/)
    for demo and tutorials.
-   [Source Tree (Atlassian)](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/): Supports interactive rebase, but tries to abstract
    a bit more ([see here](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/sourcetree/interactive-rebase-sourcetree) for details), leaving almost no
    trace of how one traditionally interacts with git for an interactive rebase.

    For those who are unaware - git is only able to heuristically say whether a file has been renamed/moved or deleted/created.
    You see this sometimes in pull requests, where people clearly moved stuff, but the diff still marks the original version as "deleted"
    and the other as "created" from scratch. Linus goes into some of the whys here, in his usual infamous way.

# Troubleshooting

1. _**My manager decided that some change needs to be prioritized, so it has to go to some `hotfix`-branch rather than `main`. What needs to be done?**_

    Check out the "rebase --onto"-section.

2. _**I used `git push` but git complains and rejects it**_

    See `git push`-section: Most likely, you need to use `git push --force-with-lease`. Do **not** use this
    on "shared" branches such as `develop`, `main`, `release-...`, `hotfix-...` etc.!

3. _**I want to change a commit message**_

    If the commit in question is your current HEAD (latest commit), just run `git commit --amend` (make sure
    you have no staged changes, using `git status`. This will allow you to change the message.

    If the commit is further down in the history, use `git rebase -i <parent-of-commit-to-be-changed>`, then
    use the `reword`-option. See also `git rebase -i`-section.

4. _**I do not care about git-history in any way. Just give me some commands to satisfy linear history and make everyone happy!**_

    To keep life really simple, one commit per pull request is the easiest and surest way to keep history linear.
    To get rid of any issues, we can do the following "manual squash" (assuming you're targeting `main` with your PR):

    ```text
    git merge origin/main               // Bring your branch up-to-date one last time. Doesn't matter if it's a merge-commit.
    git reset --soft origin/main        // See "reset"-section for details. Your HEAD will point to main, but no file is changed.
    git status                          // Check your current uncommited changes. They should be just your intended changeset
                                        // compared to main. Use your IDE/tool of preference for that.
    git commit -m "..."                 // Once you're happy, just "recommit" everything.
    git push --force-with-lease         // See "push"-section on why "--force-with-lease" is required.
                                        // DO NOT USE PULL! (see pull-section on why).
                                        // Double-check the diff- and commit-section of your PR.
    ```
